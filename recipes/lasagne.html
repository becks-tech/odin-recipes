    <p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Meat: </b>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><b>Onion and garlic: </b>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Tomato products: </b>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar: </b>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li><b>Spices and seasonings: </b>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Lasagna noodles: </b>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li><b>Cheeses: </b>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li><b>Egg: </b>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
