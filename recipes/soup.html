    <p>This is my grandma's chicken noodle soup recipe. It's very savory and tasty, and I think everyone will like it. Use smoked chicken for even more flavor!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups wide egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>12 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>3 cups diced, cooked chicken meat</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and oil, and boil until noodles are tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, rinse under cool running water, and drain again.</li>
        <li>Bring broth, salt, and poultry seasoning to a boil in a Dutch oven. Stir in celery and onion; reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until vegetables have softened, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until cornstarch is completely dissolved; gradually stir into soup. Stir in noodles and chicken, and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
